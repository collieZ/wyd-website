# PAGES

##### 这里存放所有的页面,就是有路由的页面

This directory contains your Application Views and Routes.
The framework reads all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and creates the router of your application.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing).
